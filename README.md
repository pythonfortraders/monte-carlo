This is the companion repository for [this video](https://youtu.be/6e2rVQNpb04). 

We go through the basics of Monte Carlo simulations, starting with simple examples where we use them to estimate the EV of a 6-sided die and calculate pie from a random distribution of points around the unit circle. 

Then, we get into more relevant applications by simulating stock prices as Geometric Brownian Motion and using that to value a call option. 

Lastly, we demonstrate how to use concurrency to improve the performance of large Monte Carlo simulations using a Python `ThreadPool`.
